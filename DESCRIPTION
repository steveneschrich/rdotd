Description: Unix has a long history of .d directories which consist of
 a series of config files or shell scripts prefixed by a two-digit number
 to indicate run/parse order. This is convenient for versioning/managing
 individual functions (per file) but maintaining a consistent flow. One
 place this is useful is in loading raw data; typically there are a series
 of steps that need to take place. With this library you can create an
 R.d directory, with 01-do_something.R, 02-do_something_else.R, and
 have them execute in order.
